            "See the latest FreightCar America Inc stock price (NASDAQ:RAIL), related news, valuation, dividends and more to help you make your investing decisions.FreightCar America Inc is a diversified manufacturer of railcars and railcar components in North America. The company design and manufacture a broad variety of freight cars including covered hoppers, open-top hoppers, gondolas, intermodal, and non-intermodal flat cars that transport numerous types of dry bulk and containerized freight products. No. RAIL does not currently have a forward dividend yield. Dividend yield allows investors, particularly those interested in dividend-paying stocks, to compare the relationship between a stock\u2019s price and how it rewards stockholders through dividends. The formula for calculating dividend yield is to divide the annual dividend paid per share by the stock price. High-growth stocks tend to represent the technology, healthcare, and communications sectors. They rarely distribute dividends to shareholders, opting for reinvestment in their businesses. More value-oriented stocks tend to represent financial services, utilities, and energy stocks. These are established companies that reliably pay dividends. Learn more about dividend yield.",
            "One of these stocks is an &quot;avoid&quot; and the other a &quot;buy.&quot;The company has also been free cash flow positive in the past couple of years, unlike FreightCar. And with shares trading at 11 times trailing earnings and a dividend yield of 4.5%, I think investors could even consider American Railcar's recent drop a good opportunity for long-term investing. Business has been lumpy for railcar manufacturers, but some stocks are bucking the downtrend. Shares of FreightCar America, Inc. (RAIL -0.66%) shot through the roof last month to gain a whopping 31%, posting their best monthly performance in several quarters. American Railcar's fall isn't really surprising given the company's muted quarterly earnings report that it released in early May. FreightCar, however, neither delivered a stellar earnings report nor announced anything big. So why did its shares surge? FreightCar reported its first-quarter earnings on May 3, earning only about $0.6 million in net income versus $12.7 million in Q1 2016, on 6% lower revenue. It's worth noting that FreightCar benefited from a substantial one-time gain related to retiree benefit obligations during its first quarter last year.",
