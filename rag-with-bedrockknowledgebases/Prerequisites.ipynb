    "### Role of Metadata While Indexing Data in Vector Databases  \n",
    "\n",
    "Metadata provides additional context and information about the documents, which can be used to filter, sort, and improve search accuracy. This not only helps reduce the search latency but also helps increase accuracy of responses.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The following are some key uses of metadata when loading documents into a vector data store:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Document Identification** – Metadata can include unique identifiers for each document, such as document IDs, URLs, or file names. These identifiers can be used to uniquely reference and retrieve specific documents from the vector data store.  \n",
    "- **Content Categorization** – Metadata can provide information about the content or category of a document, such as the subject matter, domain, or topic. This information can be used to organize and filter documents based on specific categories or domains.  \n",
    "- **Document Attributes** – Metadata can store additional attributes related to the document, such as the author, publication date, language, or any other relevant information. These attributes can be used for filtering, sorting, or faceted search within the vector data store.  \n",
    "- **Access Control** – Metadata can include information about access permissions or security levels associated with a document. This information can be used to control access to sensitive or restricted documents within the vector data store.  \n",
    "- **Relevance Scoring** – Metadata can be used to enhance the relevance scoring of search results. For example, if a user searches for documents within a specific date range or authored by a particular individual, the metadata can be used to prioritize and rank the most relevant documents.  \n",
    "- **Data Enrichment** – Metadata can be used to enrich the vector representations of documents by incorporating additional contextual information. This can potentially improve the accuracy and quality of search results.  \n",
    "- **Data Lineage and Auditing** – Metadata can provide information about the provenance and lineage of documents, such as the source system, data ingestion pipeline, or any transformations applied to the data. This information can be valuable for data governance, auditing, and compliance purposes.  \n"
