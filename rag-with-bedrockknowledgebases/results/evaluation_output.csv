What are the three main sub-tasks in Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) as identified in the paper?,"The three main sub-tasks in Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) as identified in the paper are: 1) Topic entity detection, 2) Entity linking, and 3) Relation detection. These sub-tasks are sequential and are used to find answers for natural language questions from structural knowledge bases (KB). The paper proposes a retrieve-and-rerank framework to access KBs via traditional information retrieval (IR) method, and re-rank retrieved candidates with more powerful neural networks such as the pre-trained BERT model. The unified model is then trained under a multi-task learning framework. The three sub-tasks are: 1) Topic entity detection: identifying the topic entity from the question, 2) Entity linking: linking the topic entity to an entity node from a list of candidate nodes, and 3) Relation detection: selecting the relation-chain leading to the final answer. These sub-tasks are essential for KBQA and are used to find answers for natural language questions from structural knowledge bases (KB). The paper proposes a unified model that shares a BERT encoder across all three sub-tasks and defines task-specific layers on top of the shared layer.

What is the primary objective of Amazon's Frontier Model Safety Framework?,"The primary objective of Amazon's Frontier Model Safety Framework is to ensure that frontier models developed by Amazon do not expose critical capabilities that have the potential to create severe risks, by establishing protocols to identify, assess, and manage potential severe risks that could arise as frontier AI models scale in size and capability. The Framework outlines the processes Amazon will use to evaluate and mitigate risks, including Critical Capability Thresholds, Critical Capability Evaluations, and Risk Mitigations. The Framework is a living document and will be updated to reflect evolving model capabilities and advances in the science underlying AI safety evaluations and mitigations. It is guided by Amazon's leadership principles, including ""Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility,"" and is designed to complement Amazon's broader approach to responsible AI. The Framework focuses on severe risks that are unique to frontier AI models and requires specialized evaluation methods and safeguards. It is intended to ensure that Amazon's frontier models are safe and secure, and that the company takes responsibility for mitigating the risks of its technology. The Framework is based on the Korea Frontier AI Safety Commitments and is a result of collaboration with governments, domain experts, and industry peers.",4549,373,4922,10188,"The primary objective is to ensure that frontier AI models developed by Amazon do not expose critical capabilities that could create severe risks, by implementing appropriate safeguards before deployment.",0.0034243,The prediction matches the ground truth exactly.,1
What are 'Critical Capability Thresholds' as defined in the framework?,"Critical Capability Thresholds describe model capabilities within specified risk domains that could cause severe public safety risks. When evaluations demonstrate that an Amazon frontier model has crossed these Critical Capability Thresholds, the development team will apply appropriate safeguards. The Critical Capability Thresholds include CBRN Weapons Proliferation, Offensive Cyber Operations, and Automated AI R&D. For CBRN Weapons Proliferation, Critical Capability Threshold AI will be capable of providing expert-level, interactive instruction that provides material uplift (beyond other publicly available research or tools) that would enable a non-subject matter expert to reliably produce and deploy a CBRN weapon. For Offensive Cyber Operations, Critical Capability Threshold AI will be capable of providing material uplift (beyond other publicly available research or tools) that would enable a moderately skilled actor (e.g., an individual with undergraduate level understanding of offensive cyber activities or operations) to discover new, high-value vulnerabilities and automate the development and exploitation of such vulnerabilities. For Automated AI R&D, Critical Capability Threshold AI will be capable of replacing human researchers and fully automating the research, development, and deployment of frontier models that will pose severe risk such as accelerating the development of enhanced CBRN weapons and offensive cybersecurity methods.",4603,365,4968,9868,"Critical Capability Thresholds refer to specific model capabilities within defined risk domains that, if present, could cause significant harm to public safety if misused.",0.0033167444444444447,The prediction exactly matches the ground truth.,1

The three risk domains identified are: * CBRN Weapons Proliferation: This risk domain focuses on the potential that a model may be able to guide malicious actors in developing and deploying CBRN weapons. * Offensive Cyber Operations: This risk domain focuses on risks that would arise from the use of a model by malicious actors to compromise digital systems with the intent to cause harm. * Automated AI R&D: This risk domain focuses on the potential that automated AI R&D processes could accelerate the development of models that pose enhanced CBRN, Offensive Cybersecurity, or other severe risks.",4607,346,4953,10227,"The framework identifies risk domains including Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) weapons proliferation and Offensive Cyber Operations.",0.003437408333333333,The prediction exactly matches the ground truth.,1
How does Amazon evaluate whether a model meets or exceeds a Critical Capability Threshold?,"Amazon evaluates whether a model meets or exceeds a Critical Capability Threshold through a combination of automated and human-in-the-loop strategies, including maximal capability evaluations, safeguards evaluations, uplift studies, expert red teaming, and benchmarking. These evaluations assess the model's capabilities against specified risk domains, such as CBRN Weapons Proliferation, Offensive Cyber Operations, and Automated AI R&D. If a model demonstrates capabilities that meet or exceed a Critical Capability Threshold, Amazon will not deploy the model without implementing appropriate risk mitigation measures. These measures may include training data safeguards, alignment training, and other safety and security measures to prevent the elicitation of the critical capability and protect against unauthorized access risks. Amazon's senior leadership will review the evaluation results and approve the mitigations prior to deployment. The company will also publish information about the frontier model evaluation for safety and security as part of the model launch. Amazon's Frontier Model Safety Framework is a living document that will be updated annually and as needed in connection with significant technological developments.",4556,310,4866,8268,Amazon conducts Critical Capability Evaluations using a combination of automated and human-in-the-loop strategies to assess if models demonstrate capabilities that meet or exceed the defined thresholds.,0.0027789666666666662,"The prediction does not exactly match the ground truth, and it is not a concise summary of the ground truth.

What actions are taken if a model is found to meet or exceed a Critical Capability Threshold?,"If a model is found to meet or exceed a Critical Capability Threshold, Amazon will not deploy the model until appropriate safeguards are implemented. The company will use a range of evaluation approaches, including automated benchmarks, expert red teaming, and uplift studies, to assess the model's capabilities. If the model is deemed to pose a severe risk, Amazon will implement a set of Safety Measures and Security Measures to prevent the elicitation of the critical capability and protect against unauthorized access risks. The company will also evaluate the model following the application of these safeguards to ensure that they adequately mitigate the risks associated with the Critical Capability Threshold. If the evaluations reveal that the model meets or exceeds a Critical Capability Threshold and the safeguards are unable to mitigate the risks, Amazon will not deploy the model until additional safeguards are identified and implemented. Examples of current safety mitigations include training data safeguards, alignment training, and the implementation of guardrails. Amazon will also continue to enhance its AI safety evaluation and risk management processes, revisiting and updating its Frontier Model Safety Framework at least annually to ensure that its protocols are robust and uphold its commitment to deploy safe and secure models.",4609,338,4947,9180,"If a model meets or exceeds a Critical Capability Threshold, Amazon applies appropriate risk mitigation measures and does not publicly deploy the model without these safeguards in place.",0.0030855,The prediction matches the ground truth.,1
