How does the proposed method handle large-scale knowledge bases efficiently?,"The proposed method handles large-scale knowledge bases efficiently by leveraging a retrieve-and-rerank strategy. In the retrieval step, it ingests knowledge bases into inverted indices on hard disk storage, which overcomes memory overhead. It uses traditional information retrieval methods like TF-IDF to collect high-quality candidates for entity linking and relation detection. In the re-ranking step, it utilizes the BERT model to fine-tune and re-rank these candidates, improving accuracy. Additionally, a unified BERT model is employed across all sub-tasks (topic entity detection, entity linking, and relation detection) under a multi-task learning framework, reducing model size while maintaining or improving performance.",3331,139,3470,1865,"The method uses an IR-based retrieval approach to collect high-quality candidates efficiently, enabling adaptation to large-scale KBs.",The prediction matches the ground truth by explaining the method's retrieve-and-rerank strategy and its application to all sub-tasks.,1
What is the role of BERT in the proposed KBQA framework?,"The role of BERT in the proposed KBQA framework is multifaceted:

1. **Topic Entity Detection**: BERT is used to predict the start and end positions of a topic entity within a question. This helps in identifying the specific entity the question is about.

2. **Entity Linking**: BERT assists in linking the identified topic entity to a corresponding entity node within the knowledge base (KB).

3. **Relation Detection**: BERT helps in detecting the appropriate relation-chain within the KB that is semantically similar to the question.

4. **Re-ranking**: After an initial retrieval step using TF-IDF to collect candidates, BERT is employed in the re-ranking step to fine-tune the candidates based on semantic matching, thereby improving the accuracy of the selected candidates.

5. **Multi-Task Learning**: To optimize resource usage, a single BERT encoder is shared across all sub-tasks (topic entity detection, entity linking, and relation detection), with task-specific layers defined on top of this shared encoder. This unified model is trained under a multi-task learning framework, leading to efficient parameter usage and improved performance.",3362,229,3591,2661,BERT is used to improve accuracy across all three sub-tasks by serving as a shared encoder in the multi-task learning framework.,The prediction provides a detailed explanation of BERT's role in accordance with the ground truth.,1

The unified model is trained under the multi-task learning framework, which helps in parameter efficiency and improved performance across all sub-tasks.",3262,96,3358,1299,Multi-task learning allows the unified model to achieve further improvements with only one-third of the original parameters.,The prediction matches the ground truth.,1

A question is deemed unanswerable if the corresponding database does not contain the data that the question is asking for.",":  How are ambiguous and unanswerable questions defined in the PRACTIQ dataset?
Ground Truth: Ambiguous questions are those that have multiple valid interpretations given the database schema. Unanswerable questions are ones where the database does not contain the information being asked for.
Prediction: The PRACTIQ dataset distinguishes between ambiguous and unanswerable questions by considering the database schema. A question is ambiguous if it's susceptible to multiple valid interpretations under the given schema. It is unanswerable if the requested information is absent from the database.
